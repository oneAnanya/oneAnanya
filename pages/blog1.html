            <h1>Beginner-Friendly Guide to Integrating Python Code into a Java Spring Project</h1>

            <p>Integrating your standalone Python code into a Java Spring project may sound complex, but fear not...ANANYA is here! <br></p>
	    <p>Get ready to bring the party to your software project! Below is a beginner-friendly recipe with simple steps to help you seamlessly blend the two languages:</p>
            
            <p>
		<h3>Step 1: Identify Integration Points:</h3>
		<p>Determine the specific functionality in your Java Spring project that requires Python integration. Understanding these integration points is crucial for a smooth process.</p>
		<h3>Step 2: Install Required Software:</h3>
		<p>Ensure Python is installed on your machine. Additionally, set up a Java development environment with a tool like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. This step ensures you have the necessary tools for both languages.</p>
		<h3>Step 3: Create a Simple Python Script:</h3>
		<p>Write a simple Python script that encapsulates the functionality you want to integrate. For example, a script that performs a specific calculation or data processing task.</p>
		<h3>Step 4: Build a JAR File:</h3>
		<p>Compile your Java Spring project into a JAR file. This can be done using build tools like Maven or Gradle. Ensure that all dependencies are included in the JAR file.</p>
		<h3>Step 5: Use Java's ProcessBuilder:</h3>
		<p>In your Java code, use ProcessBuilder to execute the Python script. This allows Java to spawn a new process and run the Python script independently.</p>
		<h3>Step 6: Communicate Data Between Java and Python:</h3>
		<p>If your Python script takes inputs or produces outputs, you need to establish a communication mechanism. One common approach is using command-line arguments and reading the script's output.</p>
		<h3>Step 7: Handle Exceptions:</h3>
		<p>Ensure your Java code includes proper error handling for scenarios where the Python script fails to execute or returns an error. This enhances the robustness of your integration.</p>
		<h3>Step 8: Test the Integration:</h3>
		<p>Run your Java Spring project and verify that the Python code executes as expected. Monitor the console for any error messages or unexpected behavior.</p>
		<h3>Step 9: Document Your Integration:</h3>
		<p>Create documentation explaining the integration points, how to run the project, and any dependencies required. This documentation will be invaluable for future reference.</p>
